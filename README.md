# Whoacab

**Spend one minute a day to improve your vocabulary.**

Whoacab is a daily gamified word-learning app where users learn a new word, prove they understand it in context, and build streaks over time.  

Think: **Wordle + Duolingo + Vocabulary.com**.

---

## Core Concept

Whoacab makes vocabulary building simple, competitive, and consistent.

Each day, users complete a short challenge (1–2 minutes) designed to reinforce contextual understanding rather than rote memorization. Progress is tracked through streaks, points, badges, and a global leaderboard.

The goal is to make learning feel like a game... not homework.
